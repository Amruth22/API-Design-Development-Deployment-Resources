**Comprehensive Overview of Modern Web API Development**

*Professional Training Series*

## Slide 2: What is an API?

### Application Programming Interface (API)

**Definition:**
- Interface that allows different software applications to communicate
- Set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications
- Defines methods of communication between various components

**Key Characteristics:**
- Abstraction layer between systems
- Standardized communication protocol
- Platform and language independent
- Enables integration and interoperability

**Real-World Analogy:**
- Restaurant menu: Defines what you can order (available functions)
- Waiter: Intermediary who takes your request and brings response
- Kitchen: Backend system that processes the request

---

## Slide 3: Web API Fundamentals

### Core Concepts

**Web API Characteristics:**
- Uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol for communication
- Stateless communication model
- Resource-based architecture
- Platform-independent data exchange

**Common Data Formats:**
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) - Most popular
- XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
- Plain text
- Binary data

**Communication Model:**
- Client sends HTTP request
- Server processes request
- Server returns HTTP response
- No session state maintained between requests

---

## Slide 4: Introduction to REST

### Representational State Transfer (REST)

**REST Principles:**
- **Stateless:** Each request contains all necessary information
- **Client-Server:** Separation of concerns between client and server
- **Cacheable:** Responses can be cached for performance
- **Uniform Interface:** Consistent way to interact with resources
- **Layered System:** Architecture can have multiple layers
- **Code on Demand:** Optional - server can send executable code

**Benefits of REST:**
- Scalability and performance
- Simplicity and ease of use
- Platform independence
- Wide industry adoption

---

## Slide 5: RESTful API Design

### Resource-Based Architecture

**Key Concepts:**
- **Resource:** Any information that can be named (users, products, orders)
- **URI:** Uniform Resource Identifier - unique address for each resource
- **Representation:** How resource data is formatted (JSON, XML)

**RESTful URL Structure:**
```
GET    /api/users          - Get all users
GET    /api/users/123      - Get specific user
POST   /api/users          - Create new user
PUT    /api/users/123      - Update entire user
PATCH  /api/users/123      - Partial user update
DELETE /api/users/123      - Delete user
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use nouns for resources, not verbs
- Use plural nouns for collections
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Use hierarchical structure for related resources

---

## Slide 6: HTTP Methods Overview

### Standard HTTP Verbs

| Method | Purpose | Idempotent | Safe |
|--------|---------|------------|------|
| GET | Retrieve data | Yes | Yes |
| POST | Create new resource | No | No |
| PUT | Update/Replace entire resource | Yes | No |
| PATCH | Partial update | No | No |
| DELETE | Remove resource | Yes | No |
| HEAD | Get headers only | Yes | Yes |
| OPTIONS | Get allowed methods | Yes | Yes |

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Safe Methods:** Do not modify server state (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS)
- **Idempotent Methods:** Multiple identical requests have same effect
- **CRUD Mapping:** Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT/PATCH), Delete (DELETE)

---

## Slide 7: HTTP Status Codes - Success & Redirection

### 2xx Success Codes

| Code | Status | Usage |
|------|--------|-------|
| 200 | OK | Successful GET, PUT, PATCH |
| 201 | Created | Successful POST - resource created |
| 202 | Accepted | Request accepted for processing |
| 204 | No Content | Successful DELETE or PUT with no response body |

### 3xx Redirection Codes

| Code | Status | Usage |
|------|--------|-------|
| 301 | Moved Permanently | Resource permanently moved to new URL |
| 302 | Found | Temporary redirect |
| 304 | Not Modified | Resource hasn't changed (caching) |

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Always return appropriate status codes
- Include meaningful response bodies when applicable
- Use 201 for successful resource creation
- Use 204 for successful operations with no content

---

## Slide 8: HTTP Status Codes - Client & Server Errors

### 4xx Client Error Codes

| Code | Status | Usage |
|------|--------|-------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid request syntax or parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication required |
| 403 | Forbidden | Access denied (authenticated but not authorized) |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource does not exist |
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | HTTP method not supported for resource |
| 409 | Conflict | Request conflicts with current resource state |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | Valid syntax but semantic errors |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limiting exceeded |

### 5xx Server Error Codes

| Code | Status | Usage |
|------|--------|-------|
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Generic server error |
| 502 | Bad Gateway | Invalid response from upstream server |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Server temporarily unavailable |

---

## Slide 9: HTTP Headers

### Essential HTTP Headers

**Request Headers:**
- **Authorization:** Authentication credentials
- **Content-Type:** Format of request body (application/json)
- **Accept:** Preferred response format
- **User-Agent:** Client application information
- **Cache-Control:** Caching directives

**Response Headers:**
- **Content-Type:** Format of response body
- **Content-Length:** Size of response body
- **Location:** URL of newly created resource (with 201)
- **Cache-Control:** Caching instructions
- **Access-Control-Allow-Origin:** CORS policy

**Security Headers:**
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevent MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options:** Clickjacking protection
- **Strict-Transport-Security:** Enforce HTTPS

---

## Slide 10: API Request/Response Cycle

### Complete HTTP Transaction

**Request Structure:**
```
POST /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer token123

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

**Response Structure:**
```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/users/456

{
  "id": 456,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "created_at": "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Processing Flow:**
1. Client constructs HTTP request
2. Request sent over network
3. Server receives and validates request
4. Server processes business logic
5. Server constructs HTTP response
6. Response sent back to client
